- fixed some file permissions to make NPM more happy

2.0.0
-----

- removed SVGZ format from Web fonts because SVGZ is really only
  needed for very ancient mobile devices and hence not worth the
  distribution extra space.

- removed HTML specimen files from Web fonts and replace them with a
  generic specimen.html at the top-level because this further reduces the
  redundancy and this way the distribution size.

- migrated from a generated index.html to a generic one which
  now loads a manifest.js (similar to the new specimen.html).

- fixed manifest: use the regular 'condensed' stretch value for 
  H.H. Samuel and not 'ultra-condensed'.

  for easy use of a particular TypoPRO font.
