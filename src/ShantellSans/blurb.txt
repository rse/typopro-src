British visual artist and philosopher Shantell Martin is famous for
using words in her artwork in the Oculus at the World Trade Center, in
New York City, and for her music and art collaboration with Kendrick
Lamar at Art Basel in Miami. Her art has taken over the screens of New
Yorkâ€™s Times Square and the Lincoln Center stage, home of the New York
City Ballet. Back in school, she was scared of spelling tests. However,
outside of school, she felt that words were art and provided emotional
relief. A discovery in her early 20s opened her eyes to why reading
and writing were so difficult for her, and set in motion her desire to
create the To inspire others to have fun with writing and words, she
teamed up with Stephen Nixon of Arrow Type to create Shantell Sans.
