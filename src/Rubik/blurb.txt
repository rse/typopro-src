Google Creative Lab approached us to design a typeface for the branding
of the Rubik's Cube Exhibition "Beyond Rubik's Cube" at the Liberty
Science Center, Jersey City. We designed a slightly rounded heavyweight
font in which the letters fit perfectly in a single cubelet of the
Rubik's Cube. The font was expanded to include Cyrillic and Hebrew
characters for the exhibition, which will travel internationally.
