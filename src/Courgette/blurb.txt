Courgette is a brushy medium to low contrast italic script. This kind of
style traditionally used for display and unsuprisingly Courgette works
well in display. However Courgette's is more versitile than that. Its
carefully made forms mean that it also works well in smaller sizes and
even in massed text. The Sorkin Type Logo is composed from glyphs in
Courgette.
