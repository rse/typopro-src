Oswald is a reworking of the classic gothic typeface style historically
represented by designs such as 'Franklyn Gothic', 'Alternate Gothic', 'News
Gothic' and more. The characters of Oswald have been re-drawn and reformed to
better fit the pixel grid of standard digital screens. Oswald is designed to
be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers,
laptops and mobile devices.
