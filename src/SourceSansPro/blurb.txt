Released by Adobe in August 2012, Source Sans Pro is Adobeâ€™s
first open-source font. Its designer, Paul D. Hunt, was inspired by
early-20th-century gothics such as Franklin Gothic and News Gothic.
Source Sans Pro feels much more modern, a little reminiscent of FF Meta.
Its intended use is for user interfaces so it renders very well at small
sizes. The font is available in an impressive 6 weights, making it
extremely versatile.
