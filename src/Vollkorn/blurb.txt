Vollkorn came into being as my first type designing attempt. I
published the Regular on my site grafikfritze.de in 2005 under a
Creative-Commons-License. Until the counter finally collapsed two years
later it had been downloaded thousands of times and used for web and
print matters. It intends to be a quiet, modest and well working text
face for bread and butter use. Unlike its examples in the book faces
from the renaissance until today, it has dark and meaty serifs and a
bouncing and healthy look. It might be used as body type as well as for
headlines or titles. "Vollkorn" (pronounced "Follkorn") is German for
"wholemeal" which refers to the old term "Brotschrift". It stood for the
small fonts for every day use in hand setting times.
