Giambattista Bodoni is known for creating one of the first "modern
serif" typefaces. Advances in printing technology during the late
eighteenth century allowed Bodoni to design letterforms with higher
contrast between thick and thin strokes, and crisp horizontal serifs.
The result is a typeface thatâ€™s recognizably elegant, refined, and
remains popular centuries after its creation.
