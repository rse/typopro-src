ET Book is a Bembo-like font for the computer designed by Dmitry Krasny,
Bonnie Scranton, and Edward Tufte. It was used in Beautiful Evidence,
and some of his other digitally released books. Tufte’s earlier
books on analytical design were set in real lead in Monotype Bembo.
While Monotype Bembo was an excellent book font, when converted to an
electronic font, it became thin and spindly (the computer people ignored
“squeeze”, the slight spreading of ink when the lead type hits the
paper). So he, Krasny, and Scranton made their own computer version and
also made some design changes (ligatures, several problems with the pi
font, some letterforms, creation of a semibold). Adam Schwartz converted
the digital font into a webfont.

ET Book consists of 5 fonts:
- Roman (lining figures)
- Roman (oldstyle figures)
- Semi-bold (oldstyle figures)
- Bold (lining figures)
- Display Italic (oldstyle figures)
