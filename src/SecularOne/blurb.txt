Secular One is an original Hebrew and Latin humanistic sans serif
typeface with a single weight. At the time of publication (2016) there
were not yet many Hebrew sans serif text typefaces. The designer Michal
Sahar wanted to create a fresh, "easy going" design, simple but not
neutral, friendly but not flattering or over-styled, straight but not
too much... and highly readable in small sizes and long paragraphs. The
Secular letterforms work equally well when used at large sizes where
the delicate and eccentric elements are revealed, making it useful for
branding purposes as well as typesetting long-form texts.
