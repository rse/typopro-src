Asap ("as soon as possible") is a contemporary sans-serif family with
subtle rounded corners. There are 4 styles: Regular, Italic, Bold and
Bold Italic. This family, specially developed for screen and desktop
use, offers a standarised character width on all styles, which means
lines of text remain the same length. This useful feature allows users
to change type styles on-the-go without reflowing a text body.
