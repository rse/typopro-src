Borel, a typographic system for primary school. What considerations
should be taken into account when approaching typography in the context
of simultaneous learning of reading and writing? Borel is a French
cursive primer — developed with primary school teachers and speech
therapists — which aims to establish a seamless connection between
cursive strokes and common typographic structure. This typeface, named
in tribute to Suzanne Borel-Maisonny (a pioneer in speech therapy),
boasts a sturdy design featuring low contrast and a generous x-height.
The letters are intentionally open and clearly differentiated while
adhering to the conventions of handwriting in French schools.
