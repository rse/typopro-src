Charter was designed by Matthew Carter in 1987 as a body text font that
would hold up well on low-resolution output devices of the day—fax
machines and 300 dpi laser printers.

Though 300 dpi printing is long gone, most of today’s computer
displays operate far below 300 dpi. Charter, unsurprisingly, holds up
admirably well as a screen font. (Matthew would go on to design the
quintessential screen fonts Verdana and Georgia for Microsoft.)

In 1992, Bitstream contributed PostScript versions of the basic Charter
family to the X Consortium. These original files are still available and
can be freely downloaded and modified. But they can be hard to find. So
I tracked them down and converted them into a new package of OTFs, TTFs,
and webfonts.

Why? Because Charter is a great font, and easily one of the best free
fonts available. So I’m doing what I can to put more Charter into the
world. If your project demands a font without licensing restrictions,
consider it.
