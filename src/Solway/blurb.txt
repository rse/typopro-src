Solway is a playful slab-serif with a charming and understated tone
of voice, inspired by the warmth of community and the idyll of
rural-living. It is a contemporary family defined by the soft corners,
ball terminals, rounded slabs that give it a welcoming and friendly
appeal. Its monoline structure and minimal stroke contrast aspire to
cohesion and stability. Available in five weights, it is suitable for a
variety of projects. It could find perfect expression within lifestyle
brands or nature, travel and foodie blogs.
