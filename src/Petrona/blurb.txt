Petronaâ€™s personality is an answer to how many characteristics can be
added to a typeface without undermining its purpose within the text-type
genre. Petrona playfully maneuvers plenty of personal touches, without
losing the essence of a design intended for legibility in digital and
print media, from headlines to body text. Uppercase glyphs have heavy
asymmetric serifs and arms with inverted angles, which combine with
lowercase designs that share a big x-height, pronounced ascenders, and
soft curves of low stroke contrast.

First published in Google Fonts in November 2011 as a single style Roman
design, it was completely redrawn in 2019 and 2020. It has evolved,
and now offers a comprehensive range of weights, a complete set of
corresponding italics, and an extended glyph set that supports over 200
Latin languages. A full set of small caps, plus ligatures, alternates,
and all kinds of numerals, fractions, punctuations, symbols, and
currencies, are included.
