NX Baskerville is a font family based on Libre Baskerville. It adds a
bold italic style and makes some other minor tweaks. The original Libre
Baskerville was designed by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida, and
New Baskerville is maintained by Daniel Benjamin Miller. The fonts, when
used with TeX or the like, are probably best at around 85% of their
nominal size for body text.
