Cousine was designed by Steve Matteson as an innovative, refreshing sans serif
design that is metrically compatible with Courier New. Cousine offers improved
on-screen readability characteristics and the pan-European WGL character set
and solves the needs of developers looking for width-compatible fonts to
address document portability across platforms.
