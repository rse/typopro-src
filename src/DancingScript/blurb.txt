Dancing Script is a lively casual script where the letters bounce
and change size slightly. Caps are big, and go below the baseline.
References popular scripts typefaces from the 50's. It relates to Murray
Hill (Emil Klumpp. 1956) in his weight distribution, and to Mistral
(Roger Excoffon. 1953) in his lively bouncing effect. Use it when you
want a friendly, informal and spontaneous look.
