"My personal handwriting has changed a number of times over the years.
Just Another Hand is a narrow brush drawn handwriting font, inspired
by the handwriting of my high school days. There's a little artistic
license taken with Just Another Hand in the sense that while I never
really wrote with a brush in high school, I wanted a cleaner stroke for
this interpretation. A little personality, a little restraint... a style
that works for all sorts of projects across the board.""
