Quando is a serifed text typeface inspired by brushy handwritten letters
seen on an italian poster from the second world war. Quando is a
flexible text typeface made for the web whose personality consistently
shows in both small and large sizes. Quando's low contrast design helps
it work better on screens and smaller sizes. Especially distinctive
letterforms include letters like the a, g, x and Q. Quando's friendly
feeling along with its clarity and familiarity makes it suitable for a
broad range of uses.
