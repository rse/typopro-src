Cascadia Code is the latest monospaced font shipped from Microsoft
and provides a fresh experience for command line experiences and code
editors. Cascadia Code was developed hand-in-hand with the new Windows
Terminal application. This font is most recommended to be used with
terminal applications and text editors such as Visual Studio and Visual
Studio Code.
