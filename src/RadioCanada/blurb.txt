CBC/Radio-Canada is a Canadian Crown corporation serving as the
national public radio and television broadcaster. The English- and
French-language service units of the corporation are commonly known
as CBC and Radio-Canada, respectively. In early 2017, work started on
a custom typeface for use by CBC/Radio-Canada. In 2021 this typeface
was expanded to cover a wider range of weights and now includes roman
and italic variable fonts. Work on support for the Unified Canadian
Aboriginal Syllabics Unicode block is a possibility as this typeface
continues to expand. This project has been selected as a winner at the
2018 Communication Arts Typography competition in the Typeface Design
category.
