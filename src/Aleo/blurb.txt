Aleo is a contemporary typeface designed as the slab serif companion to
the Lato font by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic. Aleo has semi-rounded details and
a sleek structure, giving it a strong personality while still keeping
readability high. The family comprises six styles: three weights (light,
regular and bold) with corresponding true italics.
