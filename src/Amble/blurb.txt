Amble was designed by Punchcut. In 2010 Sun Microsystems licensed it for
inclusion in their JavaFX SDK for mobile handsets and released it under
a liberal Apache License. Amble is a highly legible screen-optimized
sans-serif font family. Amble is like a slightly more open version of
Verdana and has a very distinct "K" character.
