During the 1920s, Central European type foundries joined the modernists
movements in art and design. Modernism was truly international in scope;
only three years after the founding of the German Bauhaus school,
several of its painting instructors were already exhibiting their work
in Calcutta.

Geometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design element ever
since these actors took to the world’s stage. Poppins is one of the
newest comer to this long tradition. An open source family supporting
both Devanagari and Latin, this typeface is an internationalist take on
the geometric sans genre. Many of the Latin glyphs — the ampersand,
for instance — are far more constructed and rationalist than in
previously released geometric typefaces. Poppins’s Devanagari design
is particularly new. It is likely the first-ever large Devanagari family
in this style that has been brought to market.

The Poppins family includes five weights, from Light through Bold. Each
font includes 1014 glyphs, including all of the unique conjunct forms
necessary for typesetting Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Nepali,
etc. Just like the Latin glyphs, the Devanagari forms in Poppins are
based pure geometry (particularly circles). Poppins’s letters are
practically monolinear, although optical corrections have been applied
to stroke joints where necessary, to maintain an even colour in text.
The Devanagari base character height and the Latin ascender height are
equal; Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari characters,
and the Latin x-height is set rather high.

The Devanagari glyphs in Poppins were designed by Ninad Kale. The Latin
is from Jonny Pinhorn. The Indian Type Foundry first published Poppins
in 2014.
