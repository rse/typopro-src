Tillana is a refreshingly informal family of typefaces for Devanagari
and Latin. The fonts were first published by the Indian Type Foundry as
an open source project in 2014. Coming in at 1021 glyphs per weight,
Tillana has all of the characters necessary to set a variety of European
languages, as well as Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, and
more. The Tillana family includes five styles, which range in weight
from Regular through Extra Bold. Tillana’s Latin do not connect; this
part of the family is a non-joining script type. The Devanagari part is
one of the few “true cursive” designs currently available for the
script.

Characters from both writing systems appear as if they were fluidly
handwritten, particularly the Devanagari. Tillana’s letterforms are
slanted at a 10 degree angle. The strokes are show visible contrast,
and the dynamic counter forms are one of the design’s most prominent
features. The forms involve many loops and hooks and most of the knots
are loops rather than closed, black forms. All vertical strokes in both
scripts have swelling at their tops and bottoms, and the Devanagari
characters’ central vertical strokes almost always break through the
headline. Handwriting artefacts are present in the Latin letters, too,
such as hook on the descender of the lowercase q.

Tillana’s Devanagari base character height falls vertically between
the Latin upper and lowercase letter heights. The Latin characters have
a small x-height and long ascenders and descenders. Lipi Raval designed
the Devanagari components of Tillana, and worked together with Jonny
Pinhorn on the Latin.
