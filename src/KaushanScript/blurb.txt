When making digital typefaces, the more you refine the shapes of the
letters, the more energy you take away from them. Because of that,
Kaushan Script is unrefined - and carries a lot of energy. By avoiding
typographical perfection, it stays more natural. The angles of the
vertical strokes vary a little, and the positioning along the baseline
jumps around, giving it a more rustic and natural feeling. Most script
fonts have long ascenders and descenders, and this means they look too
small when used at normal sizes on the web. This font is optimized in
such details to be very readable as a web font, even when used as small
as 16 pixels.
