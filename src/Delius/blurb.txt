Delius is a high quality comic book lettering typeface super-family; it
has several families, Delis, Delius Unicase and Delius Swash Caps. A
round marker was used to define Delius's stroke: the line gets thicker
at both ends to define the beginning and end of the stroke, as a marker
line would do, and the ductus imitates the movements of handwriting.
