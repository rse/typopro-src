PT Mono was developed for the special needs — for use in forms,
tables, work sheets etc. Equal widths of characters are very helpful
in setting complex documents, with such font you may easily calculate
size of entry fields, column widths in tables and so on. One of the
most important area of use is Web sites of “electronic governments“
where visitors have to fill different request forms. Currently PT Mono
consists of Regular and Bold styles.
