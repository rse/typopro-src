Sinkin Sans is a simple, pleasant, luxuriously proportioned and easy to
read sans-serif, supplied in all 9 standard web weights, 100 to 900,
plus italics, so the face is a comprehensive illustration of the CSS web
font numerical scale.

Sinkin Sans is designed with tiny, inconspicuous notches that sink
into verticals at the intersections of strokes, adding highlights to
congested corners. The incisions make right angles appear sharper and
improve definition in more intricate characters.

Sinkin Sans was created to be the web font for the 2014 K-Type site
redesign.
