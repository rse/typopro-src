Space Mono is an original monospace display typeface family designed
by Colophon Foundry for Google Design. It supports a Latin Extended
glyph set, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European
languages. Developed explicitly for use in headline and display
typography, the letterforms infuse a geometric slab core with novel
over-rationalized forms.
