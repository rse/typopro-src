Junicode (short for Junius-Unicode) is a Unicode font for medievalists.
Junicode currently contains 3280 characters in the regular style
(the italic, bold and bold italic styles are less complete). These
Unicode ranges are either complete in the regular style or they
contain substantial numbers of glyphs (especially those of interest to
medievalists).
