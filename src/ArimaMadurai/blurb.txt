A display font with soft edges and calligraphic feel is the main
inspiration for Arima project. It has a low contrast to allow good
rendering on screen. Legibility is always a central concern, but the
design has a lot of personality to be recognizable as a display font
to be used in headlines, brand names, and similar uses on the web. The
primary goal was to create a design that will prove popular because
it resonates with both casual and professional designers, and without
ever lowering the quality of the design. Each font in the family was
extensively tested on low resolution phones and refined to work well
as a web font in the mobile era. From the very first round of design
testing, each font was hinted with ttfautohint and refined for Windows
users.
