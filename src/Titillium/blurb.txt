Titillium is born inside the Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino as a
didactic project Course Type design of the Master of Visual Design
Campi Visivi. The aim of the project is the creation of a collective
fonts released under OFL. Each academic year, a dozen students work
on the project, developing it further and solving problems. Any type
designer interested in the amendment or revision of Titillium is invited
to co-operate with us, or develop their own variants of the typeface
according to the terms specified in the Open Font license. We also ask
all graphic designers who use Titillium in their projects to email us
some examples of the typeface family in use, in order to prepare a
case histories database. Three years after the birth of Titillium, the
project is still evolving, and even we donâ€™t know what it will become
in the future.
