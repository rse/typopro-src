Derivation: Edward Johnston’s and Eric Gill’s typefaces

This is the condensed set of styles in the Cabin font family; a
humanist sans with 4 weights plus true italics, inspired by Edward
Johnston’s and Eric Gill’s typefaces, with a touch of modernism.
Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some
elements of the geometric sans. It remains true to its roots, but
has its own personality. The weight distribution is almost monotone,
although top and bottom curves are slightly thin. Counters of the b, g,
p and q are rounded and optically adjusted. The curved stem endings have
a 10 degree angle. E and F have shorter center arms. M is splashed.
