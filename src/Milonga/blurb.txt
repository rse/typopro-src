This is a tribute to the "rioplatense" culture, so colored, full of
love and hate, family, friends and enemies stories told in countless
Tangos and Milongas (folk music genre from Argentina). This graceful,
flowing and rhythmic font is conformed by graphic elements from a kind
of classic painting from this area called “fileteado porteño”;
with terminations involving petals, round and pointy details. Milonga
is useful for headlines, where the characteristics of the font are
highlighted.
