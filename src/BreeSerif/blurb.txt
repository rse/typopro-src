In 2008 TypeTogether released the Bree typeface, a sleek sans serif
that quickly became a favorite among brand and editorial designers.
Bree Serif follows the same theme as its predecessor. It is a young and
energetic upright italic that approaches readers with hip and somewhat
elegant charm. It has a range of styles that can perform as counterparts
to the original Bree fonts. At the same time though they bring a whole
range of new and individual features that make Bree Serif a separate
type family in its own right. The characters in Bree Serif maintain
the original flavour of handwriting, but have a more subtle appearance
to support optimal editorial usage. The slabby nature of its shapes,
particularly in the heavier weights, makes for a strong impression.
