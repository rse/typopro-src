Grand Hotel finds its inspiration from the title screen of the 1937
film “Cafe Metropole” starring Tyrone Power. This condensed upright
connecting script has a classic vibe to it. It has a wonderful weight
to it that feels subtly tied to Holiday and Bakery themed designs, even
though it can work outside that genre.
