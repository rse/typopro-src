The Overlock typeface family was selected by the Letras Latinas Biennal
in 2006. The initial idea of this typeface was to simulate the Overlock
sewing technique. The special thing about these forms is the warm
feeling that they give to your text, because of the particular rounded
glyph shapes that emerge. As a result, the Overlock typeface family is
great for titles and short texts in magazine style layouts.
