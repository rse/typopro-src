STEP is a Times-like type typeface for publishing. It is based on the
STIX and XITS fonts, and includes support for OpenType mathematical
typesetting, usable with LuaTeX, XeTeX and Microsoft Office.

The STEP fonts were forked from XITS and include all the same features.
The metrics of STEP were changed in order to align with the version of
Times most commonly used in publishing. Superior and inferior figures,
small caps (for the regular font only) and old-style figures are all
included and accessible via OpenType features.
