PT Serif is a transitional serif face with humanistic terminals designed
for use together with PT Sans and harmonized with PT Sans on metrics,
proportions, weights and design. PT Serif consists of six styles:
regular and bold weights with corresponding italics form a standard
computer font family for basic text setting; two caption styles (regular
and italic) are for texts of small point sizes.
