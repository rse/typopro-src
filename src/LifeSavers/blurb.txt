Do you remember the "Life Savers" candies adds from the 50s? That
was a time when Ad Agencies actually hired Lettering Artist for they
advertising text. Before the advent of Photo Typesetting, all the text
was beautifully drawn by hand. We are going to put some love to work and
bring back the Life Savers hand-lettered Typewritter/Stymie mix.
