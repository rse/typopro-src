"Poly was my final project for the postgraduate certificate in typeface
design (University of Buenos Aires). Poly was originally designed for
aglutinative languages, (which is why it's wide) specifically a South
American indigenous language (Wayuunaiki). I paid a lot of attention
to the "diacritics zone" to harmonize and unclutter the upper zones of
the lowercase letters. Poly is a medium contrast serif font. With short
ascenders and a very high x-height, Poly is efficient in small sizes.
Thanks to its careful balance between the x-height and glyph widths,
it allows more economy and legibility than standard web serifs, even
in small sizes. The agglutinative language for which it was designed
contains very long words. The goal was to develop a typeface that would
tolerate cramped tracking and that would increase the number of letters
on a single line. Poly is a Unicode typeface family that supports Open
Type features and languages that use the Latin script and its variants.
Poly was selected for the II Ibero-american Design Biennal, Madrid and
it was also selected by SomaDesign for the list of Better Google Fonts."
