Derivation: Grotesques

Work Sans is a typeface based loosely on early Grotesques — i.e.
Stephenson Blake, Miller & Richard and Bauerschen Giesserei. There are
10 weights (the 10th Hairline weight is considered a bonus since CSS
only allows for 9 weight families). The core of the fonts are optimised
for on-screen medium-sized text usage (14px-48px) – but still can be
used in print well. The fonts extreme weights are designed more for
display use. Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen
resolutions – for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they
would be in print.
