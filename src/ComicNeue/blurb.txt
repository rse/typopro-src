Derivation: Comic Sans

Comic Sans wasn’t designed to be the world’s most ubiquitous casual
typeface. Comic Neue aspires to be the casual script choice for everyone
including the typographically savvy. The squashed, wonky, and weird
glyphs of Comic Sans have been beaten into shape while maintaining the
honesty that made Comic Sans so popular. It's perfect as a display face,
for marking up comments, and writing passive aggressive office memos.
