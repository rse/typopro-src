The new Ubuntu Font Family was started to enable the personality of
Ubuntu to be seen and felt in every menu, button and dialog. The
typeface is sans-serif, uses OpenType features and is manually hinted
for clarity on desktop and mobile computing screens. The scope of the
Ubuntu Font Family includes all the languages used by the various Ubuntu
users around the world in tune with Ubuntu's philosophy which states
that every user should be able to use their software in the language
of their choice. So the Ubuntu Font Family project will be extended to
cover many more written languages.
