Garamond Libre is a free and open-source old-style font family. It is
a "true Garamond," i.e., it is based off the designs of 16th-century
French engraver Claude Garamond (also spelled Garamont). The Roman
design is Garamondâ€™s; the italics are from a design by Robert Granjon.
The upright Greek font is after a design by Firmin Didot; the "italic"
Greek font is after a design by Alexander Wilson. The font family
includes support for Latin, Greek (monotonic and polytonic) and Cyrillic
scripts, as well as small capitals, old-style figures, superior and
inferior figures, historical ligatures, Byzantine musical symbols, the
IPA and swash capitals. The fonts are an extended fork based on designs
by George Douros.
