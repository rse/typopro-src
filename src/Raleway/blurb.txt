Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface, designed by Matt McInerney,
initially in a single Thin weight. It is a display face that features
both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary
ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as stylistic
alternates inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than it's
neo-grotesque inspired default character set.
