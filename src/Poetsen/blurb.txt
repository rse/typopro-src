Inspired by the hand painted signs in supermarkets, and the roman
structures of the classical alphabets. Poetsen is a display font, but
it's not just intended to be used on big straight to the eye titles,
since it has a large x-heigth it can be used on short paragraphs in
relatively small bodies of text.
