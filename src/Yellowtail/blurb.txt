Yellowtail is an old school flavored flat brush script typeface of
medium weight. Its mix of connecting and non-connecting letterforms lend
to its unique look and legibility. Yellowtail nods to classic 1930's
typestyles like Gillies Gothic & Kaufmann, yet has the loose visual
cadence of sign painter scripts.
