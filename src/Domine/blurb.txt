From the very first steps in the design process 'Domine' was designed,
tested and optimized for body text on the web. It shines at 14 and 16
px. And can even be used as small as 11, 12 or 13px. Harmless to the
eyes when reading long texts. Domine is a perfect choice for newspapers
or blogs where text is the main focus. It's is friendly in appearance
because it combines the classic elements of familiar typefaces that have
been in use from more than 100 years like Clarendon, Century, Cheltenham
and Clearface.
