Playfair is a transitional design. From the time of enlightenment in the
late 18th century, the broad nibquills were replaced by pointed steel
pens. This influenced typographical letterforms to become increasingly
detached from the written ones. Develop­ments in printing technology,
ink and paper making, made it possible to print letter­forms of high
contrast and delicate hairlines.

This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival
of any particular design, it takes influence from the designs of
printer and typeface designer John Baskerville, the punchcutter William
Martin’s typeface for the ‘Boydell Shakspeare’ (sic) edition, and
from the ‘Scotch Roman’ designs that followed thereafter.
