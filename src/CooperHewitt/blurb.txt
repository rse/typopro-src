Cooper Hewitt, is a contemporary sans serif, with characters composed
of modified-geometric curves and arches. Initially commissioned by
Pentagram to evolve his Polaris Condensed typeface, Chester Jenkins
created a new digital form to support the newly transformed museum.
"Developing this typeface specifically for Cooper Hewitt has been
enormously gratifying," said Jenkins. "Instead of building on the
Polaris structures, I drew everything from scratch, using the existing
forms as a rough guide for letter widths and master-stroke thicknesses."
