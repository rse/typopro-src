Quattrocento Roman is a Classic, Elegant, Sober and Strong typeface.
Their wide and open letterforms, and great x-height, make it very
legible for body text at small sizes. And their tiny details that
only shows up at bigger sizes make it also great for display use.
Quattrocento Sans is a Classic, Elegant & Sober typeface. Warm,
readable and not intrusive. It's the perfect sans-serif companion for
Quattrocento.
