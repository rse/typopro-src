Crete Round is a warm slab serif providing a hint of softness to
texts. It started as a tailored version of the original Crete fonts
- http://www.type-together.com/Crete - created specially to serve
as corporate typeface for the type design competition Letter2 -
http://www.letter2.org Crete Round is more independent from the original
with modified terminals and serifs to create two new fonts that deliver
a more contemporary and functional appearance. The tall x-height, low
contrast and sturdy slabs prove to be surprisingly efficient for web
use.
