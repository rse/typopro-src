Signika is a sans-serif with a gentle character, developed for
wayfinding, signage, and other media where clarity of information is
required. It has a low contrast and tall x-height to improve readability
of texts in small sizes as well as in large distances from the reader.
Being a typical signage typeface it is inspired by typefaces such as
Ronnia, Meta, and Tahoma.
