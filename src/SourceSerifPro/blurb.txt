Source Serif Pro is a serif typeface in the transitional style, designed
to complement Source Sans. Their close companionship is achieved by
a careful match of letter proportions and typographic color. While
designed to harmonize with its serif-less counterpart, Source Serif
often takes its own direction, in part because the two are inspired
by different historical precedents. Source Serif is loosely based on
the work of Pierre Simon Fournier, and many idiosyncrasies typical to
Fournier’s designs (like the bottom serif on the b or the middle
serif on the w) are also found in Source Serif. Without being a pure
historical revival, Source Serif takes cues from the Fournier model and
reworks it for a modern age.
