The old posters and signs in the traditional neighborhood of Buenos
Aires called Montserrat inspired me to design a typeface that rescues
the beauty of urban typography from the first half of the twentieth
century. The goal is to rescue what is in Montserrat.

As urban development changes this place, it will never return to its
original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and
unique. To draw the letters, I rely on examples of lettering in the
urban space. Each selected example produces its own variants in length,
width and height proportions, each adding to the Montserrat family. The
old typographies and canopies are irretrievable when they are replaced.

There are other revivals, but those do not stay close to the originals.
The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care,
color, contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types that
make the city look so beautiful.
