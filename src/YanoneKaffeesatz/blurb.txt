Yanone Kaffeesatz was first published in 2004 and is Yanone’s first
ever finished typeface. Its Bold is reminiscent of 1920s coffee house
typography, while the rather thin fonts bridge the gap to present
times. Lacking self confidence and knowledge about the type scene,
Yanone decided to publish the family for free under a Creative Commons
License. A decision that should turn out one of the best he ever made.
It has been downloaded over 100,000 times to date, and you can witness
Kaffeesatz use on German fresh-water gyms, Dubai mall promos and New
Zealand McDonalds ads. And of course on coffee and foodstuff packaging
and café design around the globe.

In 2009 he reworked much of the typeface and it got published in
FontShop’s FontFont Library under the new name FF Kava. You can read
more about it in an extensive article by Yves Peters on FontFeed.
