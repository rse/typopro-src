Ek Mukta is a Unicode compliant, versatile, contemporary, humanist,
mono-linear typeface available in seven weights, supporting Devanagari
and Latin scripts. This type family is a libre licensed version the Ek
multi-script family, an ongoing project to develop a unified type family
for each Indian script. The goal is to build one harmonious family
across all Indian scripts without letting the visual features of one
script dominate over others. This ensures that the fonts can be used
successfully for both single and multi-script purposes.
