HH Samuel is my new typographic design, a geometric source, extra condensed
sans serif. Finished with rounded corners which gives more light to the
counters of the source, since being so compressed reading is committed to
small sizes. It is inspired by humanist grotesque fonts condensed the early
and mid twentieth century. and retains a deco style. The font I have designed
with a proportion of 1:2,28.

Samuel HH has a large sizes optimum readability, Use it 34pt above. Find this
source very useful for the design of any piece of advertising, Either posters,
flyers, posters, Labels, etc. Also works great for titles editorial design:
Layout of magazines, newspapers and general... The source has character and
style with enough force to that graphic designers will make the most creative
in their work.

This font is dedicated to my nephew Samuel HH. It's degree and is now
preparing for university entrance, my nephew is like this letter, strong
and character.
